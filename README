This is the MPTP2078 benchmark for automated reasoning in large theories (ARLT).

There are 2078 problems in the benchmark, created by the MPTP system
from 33 Mizar articles leading to the proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass
theorem. The MML version used is 7.11.07_4.156.1112
(ftp://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/pub/system/i386-linux/mizar-7.11.07_4.156.1112-i386-linux.tar).

For copyright and copying information, see the files COPYING* in this
directory. The paper about the benchmark is now available as pre-print
at http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3446 . Use the published (probably JAR)
version for citation when it appears.


Files:

chainy/*: (packed to chainy.tar.7z in the github version)

  The 2078 problems with all previous knowledge included (the large,
  hard problems). This emulates the scenario of proving new
  conjectures over a large mathematical library.


chainy_incl/*

  Same as chainy, but using the TPTP inclusion directive.


bushy/*:

  The 2078 problems with as little dependencies as possible, computed
  by the Mizar dependency analysis. This emulates the scenario when
  knowledgable users select the premises for a new conjecture
  manually, and ask ATPs to find a proof.


headers/*

  TPTP header information for the problems, specifying the author,
  problem, article, and domain.
